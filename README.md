# Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs Randomizer

This is the page for an upcoming Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs item randomizer.

This program will read a US AotR ROM file, and shuffle the locations of the items within themselves, with rules put in place to make any game generated in this way completeable.
This project is very early in development, still in the "research" phase, do not expect it to be in a playable state anytime soon.

## Goals
 - I want to make a setting to optionally allow for either the Quick Escape book or the Spot-On Warp Device to start in your inventory, which will allow for the game to be opened up significantly.
 - I want all 100 locations to be shuffleable, including chests, NPCs, Agent 9/Sgt. Byrd missions, freestanding items and the Ripto fights.
 - I want the game to start wtih the tutorial skipped, because there aren't any items in the intro sequence and it's obnoxious.

## Future Goals (After initial release)
 - Entrances randomized
 - Glitched logic
 - Custom chest content (?)
 - Cosmetic settings
 - Multiworld (most likely through Archipelago)
 - Configurable number of hearts required to challenge Ripto
